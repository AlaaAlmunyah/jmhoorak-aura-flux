JMHOORAK is an AI-powered platform for content creators.
It helps creators on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and X (Twitter) by:

- Analyzing content performance across platforms
- Predicting audience engagement using AI models
- Providing actionable recommendations for growth

## Our Approach

We started JMHOORAK with three clear steps:

1. Persona – Studied different types of content creators (YouTubers, TikTokers, influencers) 
   and identified their pain points: low engagement, inconsistent growth, lack of insights.

2. Idea – Designed a platform that connects creators’ data from multiple platforms, 
   powered by AI to predict success and suggest improvements.

3. Persona × Idea × Viral – Combined our creator personas with the idea, testing how 
   strategies could go viral and truly resonate with audiences.

This process ensures JMHOORAK is built for creators, with creators in mind.
